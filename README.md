# DevOps 2025 - Team ReleaseRangers

This is a university project designed to enhance students learning experience by leveraging GenAI to create summaries of lecture material throughout the semester. We want to help students optimize their study time by automating the summarization process, allowing them to focus on understanding and applying rather than summarizing.

## Project Overview

Our application helps students to study efficient by leveraging LLM generated smart summaries of their lecture material. Our vision is to create one single place where one can get a summarized overview of the lecture material needed for exam preparation. We want to enable students to easily add new content throughout the semester which constantly gets summarized to always provide the student with an up to date overview of the current course content.
